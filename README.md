# Football Match Attractiveness Visualization

![Header Image](header.jpg)

## Overview

This project focuses on visualizing factors that make football matches attractive to viewers. By analyzing a dataset obtained from an online prediction system, we aim to shed light on which football matches are considered the most appealing and interesting to viewers.

## Objective

The visualization aims to represent additional factors that may influence the level of interest in a match, examining the interplay of various factors in determining the attractiveness of the game. The central question posed by the visualization is: What makes a football match attractive to viewers? Secondary questions focus on segmenting data by different game characteristics – competition level, number of goals, team composition, and nature of the games themselves – and examining how these aspects influence viewer interest and excitement.

## Dataset

The data used for analysis was sourced from FiveThirtyEight's repository. The dataset includes matches from dozens of leagues over a span of 7 years, focusing on the top 5 men's leagues in Europe. It consists of hundreds of records, each describing a football match with separate fields detailing different match characteristics and outcomes.
